Redirect ActiveRecord (Rails) reads to slave databases while ensuring all writes go to the master database.

* https://github.com/rocketjob/active_record_slave

## Introduction

active_record_slave redirects all database reads to slave instances while ensuring
that all writes go to the master database. active_record_slave ensures that
any reads that are performed within a database transaction are by default directed to the master
database to ensure data consistency.

## Status

Production Ready. Actively used in large production environments.

## Features

* Redirecting reads to a single slave database.
* Works with any database driver that works with ActiveRecord.
* Supports all Rails 3, 4, or 5 read apis.
    * Including dynamic finders, AREL, and ActiveRecord::Base.select.
* Transaction aware
    * Detects when a query is inside of a transaction and sends those reads to the master by default.
    * Can be configured to send reads in a transaction to slave databases.
* Lightweight footprint.
* No overhead whatsoever when a slave is not configured.
* Negligible overhead when redirecting reads to the slave.
* Connection Pools to both databases are retained and maintained independently by ActiveRecord.
* The master and slave databases do not have to be of the same type.
    * For example Oracle could be the master with MySQL as the slave database.
* Debug logs include a prefix of `Slave: ` to indicate which SQL statements are going
  to the slave database.

### Example showing Slave redirected read

```ruby
# Read from the slave database
r = Role.where(name: 'manager').first
r.description = 'Manager'

# Save changes back to the master database
r.save!
```

Log file output:

    03-13-12 05:56:05 pm,[2608],b[0],[0],  Slave: Role Load (3.0ms)  SELECT `roles`.* FROM `roles` WHERE `roles`.`name` = 'manager' LIMIT 1
    03-13-12 05:56:22 pm,[2608],b[0],[0],  AREL (12.0ms)  UPDATE `roles` SET `description` = 'Manager' WHERE `roles`.`id` = 5

### Example showing how reads within a transaction go to the master

```ruby
Role.transaction do
  r = Role.where(name: 'manager').first
  r.description = 'Manager'
  r.save!
end
```

Log file output:

    03-13-12 06:02:09 pm,[2608],b[0],[0],  Role Load (2.0ms)  SELECT `roles`.* FROM `roles` WHERE `roles`.`name` = 'manager' LIMIT 1
    03-13-12 06:02:09 pm,[2608],b[0],[0],  AREL (2.0ms)  UPDATE `roles` SET `description` = 'Manager' WHERE `roles`.`id` = 4

### Forcing a read against the master

Sometimes it is necessary to read from the master:

```ruby
ActiveRecordSlave.read_from_master do
  r = Role.where(name: 'manager').first
end
```

## Usage Notes

### delete_all

Delete all executes against the master database since it is only a delete:

```
D, [2012-11-06T19:47:29.125932 #89772] DEBUG -- :   SQL (1.0ms)  DELETE FROM "users"
```

### destroy_all

First performs a read against the slave database and then deletes the corresponding
data from the master

```
D, [2012-11-06T19:43:26.890674 #89002] DEBUG -- :   Slave: User Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
D, [2012-11-06T19:43:26.890972 #89002] DEBUG -- :    (0.0ms)  begin transaction
D, [2012-11-06T19:43:26.891667 #89002] DEBUG -- :   SQL (0.4ms)  DELETE FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = ?  [["id", 3]]
D, [2012-11-06T19:43:26.892697 #89002] DEBUG -- :    (0.9ms)  commit transaction
```

## Transactions

By default ActiveRecordSlave detects when a call is inside a transaction and will
send all reads to the _master_ when a transaction is active.

It is now possible to send reads to database slaves and ignore whether currently
inside a transaction:

In file config/application.rb:

```ruby
# Read from slave even when in an active transaction
config.active_record_slave.ignore_transactions = true
```

It is important to identify any code in the application that depends on being
able to read any changes already part of the transaction, but not yet committed
and wrap those reads with `ActiveRecordSlave.read_from_master`

```ruby
Inquiry.transaction do
  # Create a new inquiry
  Inquiry.create

  # The above inquiry is not visible yet if already in a Rails transaction.
  # Use `read_from_master` to ensure it is included in the count below:
  ActiveRecordSlave.read_from_master do
    count = Inquiry.count
  end

end
```

## Note

ActiveRecord::Base.execute is sometimes used to perform custom SQL calls against
the database to bypass ActiveRecord. It is necessary to replace these calls
with the standard ActiveRecord::Base.select call for them to be picked up by
active_record_slave and redirected to the slave.

This is because ActiveRecord::Base.execute can also be used for database updates
which we do not want redirected to the slave

## Install

Add to `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'active_record_slave'
```

Run bundler to install:

```
bundle
```

Or, without Bundler:

```
gem install active_record_slave
```

## Configuration

To enable slave reads for any environment just add a _slave:_ entry to database.yml
along with all the usual ActiveRecord database configuration options.

For Example:

```yaml
production:
  database: production
  username: username
  password: password
  encoding: utf8
  adapter:  mysql
  host:     master1
  pool:     50
  slave:
    database: production
    username: username
    password: password
    encoding: utf8
    adapter:  mysql
    host:     slave1
    pool:     50
```

Sometimes it is useful to turn on slave reads per host, for example to activate
slave reads only on the linux host 'batch':

```yaml
production:
  database: production
  username: username
  password: password
  encoding: utf8
  adapter:  mysql
  host:     master1
  pool:     50
<% if `hostname`.strip == 'batch' %>
  slave:
    database: production
    username: username
    password: password
    encoding: utf8
    adapter:  mysql
    host:     slave1
    pool:     50
<% end %>
```

If there are multiple slaves, it is possible to randomly select a slave on startup
to balance the load across the slaves:

```yaml
production:
  database: production
  username: username
  password: password
  encoding: utf8
  adapter:  mysql
  host:     master1
  pool:     50
  slave:
    database: production
    username: username
    password: password
    encoding: utf8
    adapter:  mysql
    host:     <%= %w(slave1 slave2 slave3).sample %>
    pool:     50
```

Slaves can also be assigned to specific hosts by using the hostname:

```yaml
production:
  database: production
  username: username
  password: password
  encoding: utf8
  adapter:  mysql
  host:     master1
  pool:     50
  slave:
    database: production
    username: username
    password: password
    encoding: utf8
    adapter:  mysql
    host:     <%= `hostname`.strip == 'app1' ? 'slave1' : 'slave2' %>
    pool:     50
```
